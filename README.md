# digital-tidepool

## Welcome to the digital-tidepool folks!

he digital tidepool is a cellular simulation that takes place entirely in the browser. 
Based on a set of initial parameters, the simulation will run its course to completion.
As an observer of the tidepool, you have the power to choose the starting values of different parameters that influence the development of the environment. 
Your challenge, should you accept it, is to bring sustainability to the tidepool.
