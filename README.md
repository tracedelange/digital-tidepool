# digital-tidepool

## Welcome to the digital-tidepool folks!

The digital tidepool is a cellular simulation that takes place entirely in the browser. This project was written almost entirely from scratch, excluding use of the PIXI 
canvas library for drawing purposes. 

If you'd like to experiment with the Digital-Tidepool you can visit [here](https://tracedelange.github.io/digital-tidepool/).

The purpose of this project was to create a microcosm of nature and give users an opportunity to tweak, experiment with and explore the different interactions that take place
inside the simulation. Thematically, the intention of this project was to highlight the fragility of ecological balance in a simple and easily digestable system.

This project was heavily inspired by the cellular automata featured in the Game of Life. Exploring the unpredictability of seemlingly simple systems is a key element being explored. 

As it currently stands, there are three elements participating in the simulation:
1. Greens, an anologue for primary producers
2. Eaters, an anologue for primary consumers
3. Hunters, an anologe for secondary consumers and apex predators of an ecosystem.
